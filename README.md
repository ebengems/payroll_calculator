Progress


On a scale of 1 to 10, i would give my team a rating of 6/10
We measured our progress based on the number of times we had meetings, the issues discussed and project features identified and completed. We also discussed the best approaches to identifying bugs and methods of fixing them.
We successfully created the constant definitions and tax rate calculations
In contrary, we don’t have a landing page yet




Technical Challenges
Cyber Attacks And System Hacking
For software development teams, cybersecurity is a top priority. The consequences of a cyber attack can be extremely detrimental, including the loss of data, the compromise of other systems, and monetary loss.


As a result of the above, we therefore took preventative measures to safeguard our user’s data against cyber-attacks and data leakage. It can be difficult to do this, especially with the constant emergence of new cybersecurity risks.


Software development teams should employ a variety of techniques to safeguard their software and data in order to solve this difficulty. Utilising firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems are a few examples. Additionally, they must use encryption and authentication, as well as maintain the most recent security fixes in their program.


Software development teams can lower the risk of cyberattacks by utilising these techniques to protect their software and data.


Experience That Is Consistent Across All Platforms
The software development sector is undergoing continuous change which increase competition. We tried to make our platform more convenient and user friendly so that they can be accessible either on a desktop computer or smartphones.
Software development teams must therefore comprehend how their products will function across various technologies and ensure that they offer a consistent user experience across various platforms.




Non Technical Challenges
A lack of dialogue
A project's communication can make or break it. An effective team works well together, tasks are distributed well, and stakeholders are kept up to date on project developments. Poor communication entails none of the aforementioned.


We handled problems with communication
A solid project management tool can encourage effective communication techniques. However, it will only ever win the Oscar for best supporting actor.


We need to roll up your sleeves and take on the problem head-on if there is a problem with effective communication in our team.


That could involve getting people together to work through a specific issue or fostering a project atmosphere that values constructive criticism as a tool for improvement.


Unrealistic deadlines
Have you ever heard the phrase, "don't overpromise and underdeliver?"

We've all stood by and observed project managers who disregarded these nuggets of knowledge. In fact, perhaps we were those project managers. It's not appealing.

Deadlines are missed, quality suffers, team members become anxious, and stakeholders are disappointed when this guidance is disregarded.

Setting improbable deadlines is a tried-and-true method of overpromising.

An effective project manager is aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their teams, as well as what they are capable of producing in a given time frame. We then bargained for realistic timeframes without hurriedly finishing the assignment.

While setting unrealistic timelines may help  win the project, they also frustrate us and our team, and have a negative impact on our job results.
